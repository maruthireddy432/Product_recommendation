# ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis and Product Search
Welcome to the Recommendation System App, an intelligent and feature-rich platform for generating personalized recommendations, analyzing customer sentiment, and enabling seamless product search. This app combines advanced machine learning techniques with natural language processing (NLP) to create a comprehensive solution for e-commerce, streaming platforms, and other domains.

# ðŸš€ Features
- Personalized Recommendations: Delivers tailored item or product suggestions based on user interactions, preferences, and behaviors.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes customer reviews or feedback to extract sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative), helping to identify customer satisfaction.
- Product Search: Implements a powerful search that enables users to find relevant products quickly using keywords.
- Efficient Nearest Neighbors Search: Uses sparse matrix representation and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for memory-efficient, fast, and scalable recommendation generation.
- Clustering Support: Groups similar users or items to uncover hidden patterns and boost recommendation quality.
- Real-Time Querying: Supports live recommendations and product searches for seamless user experiences.

# ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language.
- scikit-learn: For k-NN-based recommendation and clustering.
- SciPy: Sparse matrix representations for memory efficiency.
- NLTK/Spacy: Natural language processing tools for sentiment analysis and text preprocessing.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): For product search and keyword extraction.
- Pandas & NumPy: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization tools to analyze recommendations and sentiment trends.
  
# ðŸ“Š How It Works

## Data Preparation:
- User-product interaction data is converted into a sparse matrix for recommendations.
- Customer reviews or feedback are preprocessed for sentiment analysis using NLP techniques.
- Product descriptions are indexed for fast keyword-based searching.
## Recommendation Engine:
- Builds a k-NN-based model to recommend items to users or similar users/products.
- Optionally integrates clustering to improve recommendation quality.
## Sentiment Analysis:
- Analyzes customer reviews to extract positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
## Product Search:
- Allows users to search for products using key words.
## Evaluation:
- Assesses recommendation quality using metrics like Precision@K and Recall@K.
